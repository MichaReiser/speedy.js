Benchmark results stated per browser. Ops/s expresses the number of executions per seconds of the Speedy.js or JavaScript implementation for this particular browser (higher is better). $E$ is the margin of error in percent between the test runs, $d$ the percent difference between the results of Firefox and Chrome. The percent differences are calculated using $d = |{ops}_{ch} - {ops}_{ff}|/ \frac{1}{2}({ops}_{ch} + {ops}_{ff})$ to get symmetric measures.
